# Data Structures in Java

Data structures in Java refer to the various ways data can be organized, stored, and manipulated within a computer program. These structures provide systematic methods for handling data effectively, enabling operations like insertion, deletion, retrieval, and traversal. Let’s explore the world of data structures in Java:

## 1.What is Java?

Java is a popular object-oriented programming language known for its vast standard library and platform independence. It allows developers to create programs that run without recompilation across different platforms. The rich Java library includes various data structures that efficiently handle different data types.

## 2.Types of Data Structures in Java:

- **Arrays:** A collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **ArrayList:** A dynamic array that automatically resizes itself as needed.
- **LinkedList:** A linear collection of elements (nodes) where each node points to the next one.
- **Stack:** A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue:** A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.
- **HashMap:** Stores key-value pairs, allowing fast retrieval based on keys.
- **HashSet:** A set of unique elements (no duplicates).
- **TreeSet:** A sorted set implemented using a balanced binary search tree.
- **TreeMap:** Similar to HashMap but maintains key-value pairs in sorted order.
- **Graph:** A collection of nodes connected by edges.
- **Tree:** A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.

## 3.Advantages of Data Structures in Java:

- **Efficient memory usage:** Properly chosen data structures reduce memory overhead.
- **Improved program efficiency:** Operations like searching, sorting, and manipulation become faster.
- **Code readability:** Well-designed data structures enhance code clarity.

## 4.Classification of Data Structures:

### Primitive Data Structures:
Basic built-in data types in Java:
- **byte:** Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127.
- **short:** Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767.
- **int:** Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- **float:** Stores floating-point numbers with single precision.
- **char:** Stores individual characters.
- **boolean:** Stores true or false values.
- **long:** Stores large whole numbers.
- **double:** Stores floating-point numbers with double precision.
### Non-primitive Data Structures:
Composed of primitive data types:
- **Linear Data Structures:**
Elements arranged sequentially (e.g., arrays, linked lists).
- **Non-linear Data Structures:**
Elements not arranged sequentially (e.g., trees, graphs).

For beginners, understanding data structures in Java is essential for efficient programming. Whether you’re building algorithms, managing data, or solving real-world problems, mastering these structures is a fundamental step in your programming journey
